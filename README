Your goal is to write a script that can output a function that uses a specific set of constants.
In this case, we will target for MD5 constants: [0x67452301, 0xefcdab89, 0x98badcfe, 0x10325476]
If you look deeper into the source code used to compile the binary tests in bin folder, 
you will see that md5Init function uses all these constants and thus your script should output the starting address of this function.

That is for a specific test input your code should output the following:

* md5-O0 and m5-O0-s: your script should output 0x401212
* md5-O2 and md5-O2-s: it should output 0x4012e0
